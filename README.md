# nim
Created my own adaptation of the game Nim in high school using Java
Similar to the original game, the two participants must take turns picking up sticks in a number of piles. On any turn, a player must choose a pile and remove one or more sticks (up to the number of sticks in the pile) from that specific pile. Once that player has provided valid input, the program adjusts piles such that the piles will be arranged from least to greatest.
